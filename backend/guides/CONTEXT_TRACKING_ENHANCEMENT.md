# Contextual Reference Tracking Enhancement

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Issue:** Agent was losing track of files, folders, documents, and notes mentioned earlier in the conversation when users used pronouns or vague references like "it", "that file", "the document", etc.

**Example of Problem:**
```
User: "I uploaded a research paper about AI"
[System uploads paper.pdf]
User: "What does it say?"
Agent: ‚ùå "I'm not sure which document you're referring to."
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

Enhanced the system prompt in `backend/app/agents/voice_agent.py` with explicit **Contextual Reference Tracking** instructions.

### **What Changed:**

#### **1. Added Explicit Tracking Instructions**
```
CONTEXTUAL REFERENCE TRACKING:
- ALWAYS maintain awareness of files, folders, documents, and notes mentioned in conversation history
- When user uses pronouns (it, that, this, those) or vague references, LOOK BACK at the conversation
- Track what was discussed: 'the document' = last mentioned document, 'that note' = last mentioned note
```

#### **2. Provided Concrete Examples**
Shows the agent exactly how to handle contextual references:
```
Examples:
  * User: 'I uploaded a file about AI' ‚Üí Later: 'What does it say?' ‚Üí 'it' = the AI file
  * User: 'I saved a note called Ideas' ‚Üí Later: 'Add X to it' ‚Üí 'it' = Ideas note
  * User: 'Created folder /docs' ‚Üí Later: 'List files in that folder' ‚Üí 'that folder' = /docs
```

#### **3. System Message Awareness**
```
- Check system messages in history for uploads, note creation, and file operations
- If unclear what user is referring to, ask for clarification instead of guessing
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/agents/voice_agent.py` (Lines 219-268)

### **Changes Made:**

**Before:**
```python
system_prompt = (
    "You are a helpful AI assistant with access to multiple tools. "
    "IMPORTANT CONTEXT RULES:\n"
    "1. ONLY answer the CURRENT user question\n"
    "2. REMEMBER context about: uploaded documents, saved notes\n"
    "3. When user says 'it', 'that file' - refer to conversation history\n"
    # ... basic rules
)
```

**After:**
```python
system_prompt = (
    "You are a helpful AI assistant with access to multiple tools. "
    "IMPORTANT CONTEXT RULES:\n"
    "1. ONLY answer the CURRENT user question\n"
    "2. REMEMBER context about: uploaded documents, saved notes\n"
    "3. When user says 'it', 'that file' - refer to conversation history\n"
    # ... basic rules

    "CONTEXTUAL REFERENCE TRACKING:\n"
    "- ALWAYS maintain awareness of files, folders, documents, and notes mentioned\n"
    "- When user uses pronouns, LOOK BACK at the conversation\n"
    "- Track what was discussed: 'the document' = last mentioned document\n"
    "- Examples:\n"
    "  * User: 'I uploaded a file about AI' ‚Üí Later: 'What does it say?' ‚Üí 'it' = the AI file\n"
    "  * User: 'I saved a note called Ideas' ‚Üí Later: 'Add X to it' ‚Üí 'it' = Ideas note\n"
    "- Check system messages in history for uploads, note creation\n"
    "- If unclear, ask for clarification instead of guessing\n"
)
```

### **Key Features:**
1. **Pronoun Resolution:** Maps "it", "that", "this", "those" to actual entities
2. **Conversation History Awareness:** Actively looks back at previous messages
3. **System Message Tracking:** Uses system messages as context clues
4. **Clarification Protocol:** Asks when ambiguous instead of guessing

## üìä Expected Improvements

### **Scenario 1: Document References**
**Before:**
```
User: "Upload ML_Paper.pdf"
User: "What does it say about neural networks?"
Agent: ‚ùå "Which document are you referring to?"
```

**After:**
```
User: "Upload ML_Paper.pdf"
[System: Document uploaded: 'ML_Paper.pdf']
User: "What does it say about neural networks?"
Agent: ‚úÖ [Checks history, sees ML_Paper.pdf upload]
Agent: ‚úÖ [Uses rag_search on ML_Paper.pdf]
Response: "Based on the ML paper you uploaded, it discusses neural networks..."
```

### **Scenario 2: Note Context**
**Before:**
```
User: "Save a note called 'Project Ideas'"
User: "Add 'mobile app' to it"
Agent: ‚ùå "Which note should I update?"
```

**After:**
```
User: "Save a note called 'Project Ideas'"
[System: Note saved: 'Project Ideas']
User: "Add 'mobile app' to it"
Agent: ‚úÖ [Checks history, sees 'Project Ideas' note creation]
Agent: ‚úÖ [Uses edit_note for 'Project Ideas']
Response: "Added 'mobile app' to your 'Project Ideas' note."
```

### **Scenario 3: Pronoun Chaining**
**Before:**
```
User: "I saved a note about AI"
User: "Read it back"
Agent: ‚úÖ [Shows note]
User: "Add Python to it"
Agent: ‚ùå "Which note?" [Lost context after 2 turns]
```

**After:**
```
User: "I saved a note about AI"
User: "Read it back"
Agent: ‚úÖ [Shows note]
User: "Add Python to it"
Agent: ‚úÖ [Maintains reference chain: it ‚Üí AI note]
Response: "Added 'Python' to your AI note."
```

## üß™ Testing

**Comprehensive test scenarios created in:**
- `backend/CONTEXT_TRACKING_TEST.md`

**Test Categories:**
1. Document Upload Context
2. Note Context Tracking
3. Multiple Files - Disambiguation
4. Cross-Reference System Messages
5. File Operation Context
6. Pronoun Chaining

# Visit http://localhost:8000/docs
# Follow test scenarios in CONTEXT_TRACKING_TEST.md
```

## üéì How It Works

### **Context Flow:**

```
1. User mentions file/note
   ‚Üì
2. System creates system message (e.g., "[SYSTEM] Note saved: 'Ideas'")
   ‚Üì
3. Conversation history stored in database
   ‚Üì
4. Next user message uses pronoun ("Add X to it")
   ‚Üì
5. Agent receives:
   - System prompt with tracking instructions
   - Last 5 messages including system messages
   ‚Üì
6. Agent processes:
   - Sees pronoun "it"
   - Checks conversation history
   - Finds system message about 'Ideas' note
   - Maps "it" ‚Üí 'Ideas' note
   ‚Üì
7. Agent uses correct tool with correct reference
```

### **System Message Examples:**

**Document Upload:**
```
[SYSTEM] Document uploaded: 'AI_Research_2025.pdf' (45 chunks).
User can now ask questions about this document.
```

**Note Creation:**
```
[SYSTEM] Note saved: 'Meeting Notes' (File: Meeting Notes.txt).
User can retrieve this note anytime.
```

**Note Editing:**
```
[SYSTEM] Note edited: 'Project Ideas' (content appended).
```

These system messages serve as **breadcrumbs** that the agent follows to maintain context.

## üí° Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**
   - Users can speak naturally ("it", "that", "the file")
   - No need to repeat file/note names constantly
   - Conversation flows more naturally

2. **Fewer Errors**
   - Agent doesn't lose track of uploads
   - Reduces confusion about which file/note to use
   - Less back-and-forth clarification needed

3. **Multi-Turn Context**
   - Maintains context across 5+ conversation turns
   - Handles pronoun chains (it ‚Üí that ‚Üí the note)
   - Survives topic switches (weather query doesn't erase document context)

4. **Intelligent Disambiguation**
   - Asks for clarification when multiple files exist
   - Doesn't guess or use wrong file
   - Provides clear options when ambiguous

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### **Potential Improvements:**

1. **Entity Tracking in State**
   - Add explicit entity tracker to agent state
   - Track: `{current_document: "X.pdf", current_note: "Y", current_folder: "Z"}`
   - Even more reliable than prompt-based tracking

2. **Reference Resolution Step**
   - Add pre-processing step before tool calling
   - Explicitly resolve all pronouns to entities
   - Log resolution decisions for debugging

3. **Richer System Messages**
   - Include file paths, note IDs, metadata
   - Example: `[SYSTEM] Document uploaded: 'paper.pdf' (ID: 42, Path: /docs/paper.pdf)`
   - Gives agent more information to work with

4. **Cross-Session Context**
   - Allow referencing files/notes from previous sessions
   - Implement session history linking
   - "The note I created yesterday" ‚Üí search across sessions

5. **Context Summary**
   - Periodic context summary messages
   - "Currently discussing: Document 'X.pdf', Note 'Y'"
   - Helps maintain context in very long conversations
