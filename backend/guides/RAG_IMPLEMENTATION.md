# RAG Implementation Summary

## üéâ What We Just Built

You now have a **production-grade RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system** with advanced chunking and re-ranking!

---

## üì¶ Components Added

### 1. **Vector Store Service** ([vector_store.py](app/services/vector_store.py))

**What it does:**
- Manages ChromaDB vector database
- Handles document ingestion (PDFs, TXT files)
- Performs semantic search
- Integrates chunking strategies
- Applies re-ranking for better results

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Configurable chunking strategies
- ‚úÖ Optional re-ranking
- ‚úÖ Document tracking
- ‚úÖ Collection statistics

**Usage:**
```python
from app.services.vector_store import get_vector_store

vector_store = get_vector_store()

# Ingest document
result = vector_store.ingest_document("path/to/doc.pdf", "pdf")

# Search
results = vector_store.search("What is machine learning?", k=3)
```

---

### 2. **Advanced Chunking** ([chunking.py](app/services/chunking.py))

**Three Strategies:**

#### A. **Recursive Character Splitter** (Default - Recommended)
```python
# How it works:
1. Tries to split on paragraphs (\n\n)
2. Falls back to sentences (.)
3. Then spaces, then characters
```

**Why it's best:**
- Preserves document structure
- Keeps related content together
- Works for most documents

#### B. **Token-Based Splitter**
```python
# Splits by token count
# Use for: Code, technical docs
```

**Why use it:**
- Precise token counting
- LLM context-aware
- Good for specific use cases

#### C. **Semantic Chunking**
```python
# Groups by meaning/topic
# Use for: Books, research papers
```

**Why it's powerful:**
- Keeps topics together
- Natural boundaries
- Best retrieval quality

**Configuration:**
```python
vector_store = VectorStoreService(
    chunking_strategy="recursive",  # or "token", "semantic"
    enable_reranking=True
)
```

---

### 3. **Re-Ranking Service** ([reranking.py](app/services/reranking.py))

**What is Re-Ranking?**

```
Initial Search (Vector Similarity):
‚îú‚îÄ Fast (~50ms)
‚îú‚îÄ Approximate results
‚îî‚îÄ Gets top 15 candidates

Re-Ranking (Cross-Encoder):
‚îú‚îÄ Slower (~200ms)
‚îú‚îÄ Accurate relevance scoring
‚îî‚îÄ Returns top 3 best results
```

**How it works:**
1. Vector search retrieves 15 candidates (fast)
2. Cross-encoder scores each query-document pair (accurate)
3. Returns top 3 after re-ranking

**Example:**

Query: "How to train a neural network?"

**Before Re-ranking:**
1. "Neural networks overview" (similarity: 0.82)
2. "Training procedures for ML" (similarity: 0.80)
3. "Network architectures" (similarity: 0.79)

**After Re-ranking:**
1. "Training procedures for ML" (relevance: 0.95) ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
2. "Step-by-step training guide" (relevance: 0.88) ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
3. "Neural networks overview" (relevance: 0.82) ‚¨áÔ∏è

**Benefits:**
- üéØ Better precision
- üìà Higher relevance
- ‚ö° Minimal latency increase

---

### 4. **RAG Search Tool** ([rag_search.py](app/tools/rag_search.py))

**LangChain Tool for the Agent:**

```python
class RAGSearchTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "rag_search"
    description: str = "Search the knowledge base..."

    def _run(self, query: str, k: int = 3) -> str:
        # Searches ChromaDB
        # Returns formatted results
```

**Integrated with Agent:**
- Agent automatically calls this tool when user asks about documents
- Gemini decides when to use RAG vs web search
- No manual routing needed!

## üõ†Ô∏è API Endpoints

### Upload Document
```bash
POST /api/upload-document
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: your_document.pdf
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Document processed and added to knowledge base (42 chunks created)",
  "filename": "your_document.pdf",
  "status": "processed",
  "document_id": 1,
  "details": {
    "status": "success",

  "session_id": "user123"
}
```

**Response:**
```json

## üìä Configuration Options

In [config.py](app/config.py):

```python
# Embedding Model
EMBEDDING_MODEL: str = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
EMBEDDING_DIMENSION: int = 384

# Chunking
CHUNK_SIZE: int = 1000        # Characters per chunk
CHUNK_OVERLAP: int = 200      # Overlap between chunks

# Retrieval
TOP_K_RESULTS: int = 3        # Final results to return

# ChromaDB
CHROMA_COLLECTION_NAME: str = "documents"
CHROMA_DB_PATH: str = "./data/chroma_db"
```

**Tuning Guidelines:**

| Document Type | Chunk Size | Overlap | Strategy |
|--------------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Articles** | 800-1200 | 150-250 | Recursive |
| **Code Docs** | 500-800 | 100 | Token |
| **Books** | 1000-1500 | 200-300 | Semantic |
| **FAQs** | 300-500 | 50-100 | Recursive |

## üß™ Testing RAG

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Start Server
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Step 3: Upload a Document
Go to http://localhost:8000/docs
1. Find **POST /api/upload-document**
2. Upload a PDF or TXT file
3. Wait for processing (you'll see chunk count)

### Step 4: Ask Questions
1. Find **POST /api/chat**
2. Ask: "What is the main topic of the document?"
3. Check `tools_used` - should see `["rag_search"]`

## üîç Debugging Tips

### No search results?
```python
# Check collection stats
from app.services.vector_store import get_vector_store
vs = get_vector_store()
print(vs.get_collection_stats())
```

### Chunking too small/large?
Adjust in `config.py`:
```python
CHUNK_SIZE: int = 1500  # Increase for more context
CHUNK_OVERLAP: int = 300  # Increase to capture more
```

### Re-ranking slow?
Disable temporarily:
```python
vector_store = VectorStoreService(enable_reranking=False)
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start with defaults** - Recursive chunking + re-ranking works for 90% of cases

2. **Test different chunk sizes** - Smaller = precise, Larger = context

3. **Monitor performance** - Check logs for search times

4. **Use re-ranking for important queries** - Worth the 100-200ms latency

5. **Experiment with models** - Try different embedding models for your domain
