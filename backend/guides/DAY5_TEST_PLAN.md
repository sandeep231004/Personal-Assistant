## ‚ö° **Performance Benchmarks**

### Target Latencies:
| Component | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| STT (10s audio) | <2s | Time to transcribe average query |
| Agent Processing | <2s | Existing agent + tools |
| TTS (50 words) | <1s | Time to generate speech |
| **Total Voice Chat** | **<5s** | End-to-end response time |

### Performance Tests:
- [ ] Measure STT latency with 5-second audio
- [ ] Measure STT latency with 10-second audio
- [ ] Measure STT latency with 30-second audio
- [ ] Measure TTS latency with 10 words
- [ ] Measure TTS latency with 50 words
- [ ] Measure TTS latency with 200 words
- [ ] Measure complete voice chat latency (end-to-end)
- [ ] Test concurrent requests (5 simultaneous voice chats)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during operation
- [ ] Monitor CPU usage during operation

### Optimization Targets:
- [ ] If STT >3s: Consider using "tiny" model for faster inference
- [ ] If TTS >2s: Optimize chunking strategy
- [ ] If total >7s: Investigate parallel processing opportunities
